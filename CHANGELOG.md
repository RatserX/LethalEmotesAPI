- Version 1.0.3: Fixed the need to disable the base animator when emoting, this means we touch the base stuff even less so there should be truly no compat issues with other emote mods. Fixed a bit of teleporting when you use more than one root motion emotes at once.

- Version 1.0.2: Actually did the position lock fix, oops.

- Version 1.0.1: Fixed some issues with setting samples for audio syncing. Fixed an issue with teleports interacting weird with position locks. Made the emote preview in settings a bit less jank.

- Version 1.0.0: Initial Release
