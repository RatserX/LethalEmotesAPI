# IMPORTANT

- This does nothing on without other mods. Please don't download this on its own and complain to me unless you really want to.

- If you are unsure how to do animations, hold C in game (default keybind) and click settings in the top right

## WIKI

- I have set up a wiki which should cover the basics of importing animations
